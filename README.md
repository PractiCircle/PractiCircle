Fireballs, icicle walls, darkness falls. Some may call it Black Magic, but I call it Black Geometry.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @PractiCircle
- 👀 I’m interested in making fun code and useful code! I am currently considering making a Minecraft Forge mod and a discord bot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Michigan Tech!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything! I'm still learning code, so I'll take any experience.
